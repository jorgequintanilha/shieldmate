EDH Shieldmate Source Code

Gonna keep only the code here due to obvious reasons.

So! I am a beginner developer and decided to try my hand at javascript / css. This app is more of a learning process than a product itself.

So, main issues about the code overall: It has a lot of hard coded stuff, and this bothers me a lot. I've been meaning to get to that but since time is limited, I decided to make a priority out of the stuff the user will actually see and use. The javascript isn't brilliant either.

<h2>Planned features for sometime in the future</h2>
    <h4>Saving matches:</h4> Not a priority. Could code something to save it in the storage, but I see no real point in it. Saving matches serve no purpose unless the user absolutely has to reset his phone.
    <h4>Rearranging panels:</h4>Also not a priority. Looking for a drag-and-drop solution that doesn't require jQuery.
    <h4>Different table designs for 3, 4 and 5 players:</h4> Want to, but it'll require a LOT of rework in some stuff I did back then due to lack of oversight. This is a good incentive because it'll improve code quality.
    <h4>Rearranging auxiliar counters:</h4> Also not a priority, but it'd be a very interesting design challenge. I'll look up some better way to hide and display stuff than to use invisibility via css.
    <h4>Tracking Partner Commander Castings:</h4> It'd be good but since this is a very niche situation, I am still encouraging players to use the experience counters for now, since those two very rarely go together. 
    <h4>Commander damage to self and / or from partners:</h4> The extra columns are doing a fine job for now. I will make it clearer in the tutorial. The main problem with this is purely aesthetic though.
    <h4>Lethal commander damage dimming a player panel to indicate that he lost:</h4> I'm still on the fence about this one. It is so easy to make mistakes in the commander chart, and I wouldn't like to code a billion verification procedures every time a player taps something, it'd be unnecessary overhead over something so small.
    <h4>Auto adjustable font size for player name:</h4> This is probably the next thing I'm going to do because A) it's simple and B) it's great.
    <h4>Redo ALL the background in regards to transparency and size:</h4> This will also be on the next update, but it'll be a lot of work. And It'll feature a hidden theme! :D
    <h4>Rework the CSS to be truly responsive:</h4> Not a priority but it is something I'll eventually need to get to. Media queries and all that.
